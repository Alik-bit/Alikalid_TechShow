## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔷 Zynq LED Interrupt Controller (Vivado, SDK, ZedBoard)
- Built an embedded system using **Zynq PS+PL architecture**
- Used push buttons to trigger **external interrupts** for controlling four LED counters
- Configured **AXI interconnect**, dual **GPIO controllers**, and wrote control logic in **C SDK**
- Demonstrated real-time control of LEDs via BTNU, BTND, BTNL, BTNR, and BTNC

### 🔷 Automated Water Irrigation System (ESP32, Sensors, PCB)
- Designed and soldered a custom PCB integrating **XKC-Y25-PNP**, moisture sensors, and relays
- Used **ESP32** to control water pumps based on soil moisture and tank level readings
- Implemented **timeout**, **watchdog**, and error-handling logic for reliability
- Migrated from ultrasonic to non-contact sensors for better consistency

### 🔷 UART Communication System (Verilog, FPGA)
- Created a UART interface to convert decimal to hexadecimal and handle edge cases
- Developed 4-stage parser: numeral conversion, A–F handling, invalid entry filtering, prefix processing
- Debugged baud rate mismatch issues for reliable serial output

### 🔷 RGB LED Duty Cycle Control (Microchip, MPLAB X)
- Configured **Output Compare** pins to drive RGB LEDs with PWM
- Mixed primary colors using variable duty cycles and timer settings
- Analyzed visual output and fine-tuned timing for desired color blending
