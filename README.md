### 🎲 Two-Player Dice Game (ZedBoard + UART + C# GUI)
This project implements a two-player dice game using the ZedBoard (Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC), where the embedded system communicates with a Windows-based C# graphical user interface (GUI) via UART serial. Each player takes turns rolling a virtual dice over five rounds, with their scores accumulated and displayed on the GUI. After five turns each, the player with the highest total wins.

The project was developed using the Vivado Design Suite, Xilinx IP blocks, and embedded C code. It demonstrates real-time hardware-software communication, user-friendly interface design, and the integration of embedded hardware with desktop applications.

**Key Technologies:**
- Vivado Design Suite
- Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC
- UART Serial Communication
- Embedded C
- C# Windows Forms GUI
🌡️ Real-Time Temperature Monitoring & Data Logging
  -Designed a system using LM35 sensor with firmware for real-time measurement and UART-based data logging.
  -Developed embedded firmware in **MPLAB IDE** for the **PIC28 microcontroller**  to continuously measure, average, and transmit temperature data via  via **UART**.
  -Created a **Python-based serial communication** interface to capture data from the microcontroller,
      timestamp readings, and log them into CSV format for further analysis.

🔐 Secure Cloud Data Transmission
- Engineered a secure data transmission system using RSA encryption, DFS (Distributed File System), and SSH key authentication.
- Deployed the system on Virtual Private Servers (VPS) with geographically distributed storage for redundancy and security.
-Configured secure file access and permission controls to prevent unauthorized entry and support scalable, multi-user environments.
