## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🎲 Two-Player Dice Game (ZedBoard + UART + C# GUI)
This project implements a two-player dice game using the ZedBoard (Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC), where the embedded system communicates with a Windows-based C# graphical user interface (GUI) via UART serial. Each player takes turns rolling a virtual dice over five rounds, with their scores accumulated and displayed on the GUI. After five turns each, the player with the highest total wins.

The project was developed using the Vivado Design Suite, Xilinx IP blocks, and embedded C code. It demonstrates real-time hardware-software communication, user-friendly interface design, and the integration of embedded hardware with desktop applications.

**Key Technologies:**
- Vivado Design Suite
- Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC
- UART Serial Communication
- Embedded C
- C# Windows Forms GUI

### 🔷 Automated Water Irrigation System (ESP32, Sensors, PCB)
- Designed and soldered a custom PCB integrating **XKC-Y25-PNP**, moisture sensors, and relays
- Used **ESP32** to control water pumps based on soil moisture and tank level readings
- Implemented **timeout**, **watchdog**, and error-handling logic for reliability
- Migrated from ultrasonic to non-contact sensors for better consistency

### 🔷 UART Communication System (Verilog, FPGA)
- Created a UART interface to convert decimal to hexadecimal and handle edge cases
- Developed 4-stage parser: numeral conversion, A–F handling, invalid entry filtering, prefix processing
- Debugged baud rate mismatch issues for reliable serial output

### 🔷 RGB LED Duty Cycle Control (Microchip, MPLAB X)
- Configured **Output Compare** pins to drive RGB LEDs with PWM
- Mixed primary colors using variable duty cycles and timer settings
- Analyzed visual output and fine-tuned timing for desired color blending
